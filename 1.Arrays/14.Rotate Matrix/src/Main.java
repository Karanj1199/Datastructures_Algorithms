//Rotate Matrix
//Given an image represented by an NxN matrix write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
//
//You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
//
//DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

//TIP To <b>Run</b> code, press <shortcut actionId="Run"/> or
// click the <icon src="AllIcons.Actions.Execute"/> icon in the gutter.
